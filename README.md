## Overview

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) often produce solutions that appear globally accurate
while concealing large local errors. This repository implements a post-hoc spectral error
indicator framework that analyzes intermediate PINN training snapshots using Dynamic Mode
Decomposition (DMD).

By extracting spectral features (modal energy distribution, eigenvalue drift, and spectral
entropy) from training epoch sequences, we train lightweight regression models to map these
features to local PDE solution errors. This provides a solver-agnostic mechanism to flag
high-error spatial regions and drive adaptive collocation refinement, without requiring access
to ground-truth data at inference time.

## Key Features

- **Unsupervised Feature Extraction**: DMD tracks spatial modes and eigenvalue trajectories across training epochs with no labels required.
- **Spatial Error Regression**: Three regression heads are benchmarked: Ridge (Phase 1), XGBoost, and 1D CNN (Phase 2).
- **Adaptive Refinement**: High-error hotspots are flagged dynamically to guide targeted collocation point placement.
- **Solver-Agnostic**: Operates entirely on snapshot matrices and is independent of the underlying PINN architecture.

## Results - Phase 1 (Burgers' Equation Benchmark, Ridge Baseline)

Phase 1 implements the full pipeline on a synthetic Burgers' equation benchmark with a known
analytical solution (Cole-Hopf transformation), allowing exact ground-truth error maps.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| DMD Rank (r) | 15 modes |
| Spectral Entropy H | 2.6943 |
| Top Eigenvalue \|lambda\| | 1.0000 (neutrally stable) |
| Regression MAE | 0.00095 |
| Regression R2 | 0.082 |
| Pearson Correlation | 0.287 |
| Adaptive Refinement Gain | 16.1% error reduction in flagged regions |
| High-error points flagged | 25 / 100 spatial points |

**Key observations:**

- Spectral entropy decreases monotonically across training epochs, confirming it carries convergence information.
- Adaptive refinement correctly localizes the shock front (|x| < 0.15).
- Ridge gives a useful baseline but leaves room for nonlinear heads.

## Results - Phase 2 (XGBoost + CNN)

Phase 2 extends the same benchmark and DMD features with two nonlinear heads: XGBoost and a
minimal 1D CNN over spatial DMD mode fields.

| Model | MAE | R2 | Pearson Corr | Refinement Gain |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Ridge - Phase 1 baseline | 0.00095 | 0.082 | 0.287 | 16.1% |
| XGBoost - Phase 2A (5-fold OOF) | 0.00099 | -0.005 | -0.098 | 0.0% |
| 1D CNN - Phase 2B | 0.00097 | 0.042 | 0.359 | 16.3% |

**Phase 2 findings:**

- **XGBoost underperforms Ridge** on this dataset. With only 100 spatial points and 46 features, the model does not generalize well in OOF evaluation.
- **CNN improves correlation** over Ridge (0.359 vs 0.287) by exploiting spatial locality in DMD mode fields.
- **Adaptive refinement is comparable** between Ridge and CNN (16.1% vs 16.3%), indicating both localize the shock region effectively.
- **Main bottleneck is sample count** (N=100), suggesting higher-resolution grids and real PINN snapshots are the next step.

## Output Safety and Reproducibility

Running Phase 2 does not alter legacy Phase 1 artifacts.

- Phase 1 output remains at outputs/spectral_error_results.png.
- Phase 2 writes a separate file at outputs/phase2_results.png.
- Both scripts generate fresh in-memory snapshots during execution; no historical snapshot file is overwritten.

## Installation

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost
```

On macOS, if xgboost reports a missing OpenMP runtime, install:

```bash
brew install libomp
```

---

## Quick Start

**Phase 1 - Ridge baseline:**

```bash
python spectral_error_pipeline.py
```

**Phase 2 - XGBoost + CNN heads:**

```bash
python phase_2.py
```

Phase 2 saves a 12-panel comparison figure to outputs/phase2_results.png.
